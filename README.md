# Short-Term-Temperature-Forecast

In this project a baseline is built for predicting temperature data for Berlin based on ARIMA model, including folowwing steps:

- Building a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality

- Plotting and inspecting the different components of a time series

- Modelling time dependence of the remainder using ARIMA model

- Comparing the statistical output of different AR models

- Testing the remainder for stationarity
